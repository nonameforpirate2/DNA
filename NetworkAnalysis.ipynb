    "BRIEFLY DISCUSSION ABOUT THE AIM OF THE ASSIGNMENT AND THE DATA SCIENCE BACKGROUND. SKIP IF YOU WANT TO READ THE EXERCISE.\n",
    "This assignment is an inspiration from a university asignment, that I got from the University of Leiden in The Netherlands. This version is more advanced, due to the additional natural language processing and the big data, the original asignment had a very well structured dataset. I took one subject in that University \"Databases and Data Mining\". Since I am not showing any information about my engineering knowledge on social media, my aim through this document is to potray my engineering skills to the company. It has \"Machine Learning\", which I learn by going to the Machine Learning Lectures and by reading the O'really books, unfortunately this self learned knowledge can not be stated on the university Transcript. I undertand well about supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and how to apply the machine learning algorithms according to a specific task. For example, when you should apply a clustering algorithm or a simple linear regression. Furthermore, I have experience of working with geospatial data. I had a project about data evaluation as well, thus I understand the importance of selecting measures, according to the evaluation task. The measure selection should take place according to the specific algorithms used and the desired improvement area. I followed an extra subject about time series analysis \"Cyber Data Analytics\"(it is not on Transcript). I learned ARMA models and Imbalanced Learning. This assignment does not include a time series task (unfortunately). Personally, as SCADA engineer I do understand the importance of analysing automation systems with time series. My aim is to show the company that I am able to translate a real world messy data into a meaningful prediction. In this case, cancer prediction. Furthermore, I took a subject about Big Data, I learned the risk-cost of hardware selection and using certain commands over big RDDs. For example using collect() from spark. Finally, thanks to the \"Software Architecture Lecture\" and the \"Web Data Management Lecture\", I learned how to judge technology and understand the insights behind the engineering projects. For example, the technical debt in software or in documentation level. Being able to understand how noSQL systems behave, for example using Mongo DB is a problem when you need to do a lot of data aggregation, but very good to show information. All of it due to the software architecture. Hereby, I will demonstrate my abilities to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform proper data preprocessing.\n",
    "- Perform natural language processing.\n",
    "- Use map and reduce operations.\n",
    "- Use streaming data.\n",
    "- Translate data into a graph and extract information from a network.\n",
    "- My ability to apply supervised learning.\n",
    "- My ability to detect and handle imabalanced data.\n",
    "- Data Reduction using the PCA algorithm (The Principal Component Analysis)\n",
    "- Data Visualization with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "*From my point of view the application of graph theory is very handy to improve logistics in companies. Specially if we are talking about analyzing information from point A to point B."

    "Cancer prediction based on proteins reaction is a well known area of research. I took the two datasets from the [STRING-DB](http://string-db.com/cgi/about.pl?UserId=5TxY7dSydT1P&sessionId=5ORGODdUqdfP), which is a database well known for sharing protein-protein interactions. The first dataset contains a series of Proteins names with descriptions \"9606.protein.info.v11.0.txt\" = [Protein, Description]. The second dataset contains an interaction description \"9606.protein.links.full.v11.0.txt\" = [protein1, protein 2, neighborhood, neighborhood_transferred, fusion, cooccurence, homology, coexpression, coexpression_transferred, experiments, experiments_transferred, database, database_transferred, textmining, textmining_transferred, combined_score]. What the fields represent? Personally, I will leave that to the corresponding research area, but what I am going to do is, to account for all the features generated in the bioinformatics research area to infer whether a protein will be directly linked to cancer or not in a negative way. Because, according to the descriptions some proteins are related to cancer but they tend to protect the biologic system against it. "

    "In my studies at TU Delft I learned to use AWS. Thus, I decided to run the code in a AWS Jupyter Notebook with an EMR cluster. For the AWS configuration I used the S3 Bucket, an r3.xlarge instance (good price vs computational power) and a Jupyter Notebook (AWS). My findings were quite negative. Unfortunately, even in the cluster the properties were not extracted. I concluded that, even if the python library is called from a cluster, the computational cost of finding out the properties of each node, in a graph of around 20,000 nodes and 11 million edges turns out to be too complex. The involved library architecture does not support to work with too complex datasets, I will describe NetworkX as a good library for small datasets. The option of using GraphX from spark (well known for big data) does not support the graph property extraction such as closeness, betweenness etc. Thus, I decided to proceed with using pyspark and aggregating the edge data per node with map and reduce operations, using the network dataset (see [Working with the Graph (part2)]). From my personal point of view, finding the properties of the network and the data aggregation from the edge information will be perfect to strongly predict cancer. However, due to the current technology. I ended up using NetworkX only to extract the amount of neighbors per node."

Thus, I found out the [ GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/user-guide.html#triangle-count) library, which works well with SQL-Pyspark. I used the library to extract the outDegrees and inDegrees and the number of triangles passing to each node. I can describe the library to be quite handy to process bigger files, but still they do not offer the previous mentioned properties (Betweenness, Closenness and Centrality Degree). The reason for that is the complexity involved in computing them. Overall, I extracted a dataset where I had a protein id with outDegrees, inDegrees and the triangle count(pending). "
